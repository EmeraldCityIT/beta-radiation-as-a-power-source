# beta-radiation-as-a-power-source
Mass electrons ejected by a source of beta radiation can be used as a source of current to power electronic circuits.
Current nuclear energy uses heat to boil water and driver turbines which then generate electricity. Using new methods to safely harness potential from nuclear sources provides our planet with a safer lifestyle.

Beta radiation skips the heat, boiling, water expansion and electricity induction by turbine. Supersonductive casing will be used to carry ejected electrons from a radioative source to functioning power grids.

Decay does not stop when power absorbtion stops.
Superconductors which generate less electron transfer friction are needed for efficient transfer.
